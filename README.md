# Zika_epidemic
Zika epidemic was one of the worst epidemics that happened recently. It started out in Brazil and later spread to many parts of North and South America. It also spread to many islands of the Pacific and South-east Asia.  So this project takes a sample dataset about the spread of the epidemic and tries to understand the various dynamics regarding the spread of the epidemic.
This dataset shares publicly available data related to the ongoing Zika epidemic. It is being provided as a resource to the scientific community engaged in the public health response. 
Our job was to analyse this given dataset in order to find the different aspects for the spread of the zika epidemic in different countries over a span of one year.
The dataset is presented to us in the form of the file cdczika.csv, which is a csv(comma separated value) format file.
The fields in the file include:-  report_date : Date on which the observation was reported, location : The place where the observation was recorded, location_type : The type of location(province, municipality, etc), data_field : The type of observation recorded, data_field_code : The code of the data field, time_period : The time period if applicable, time_period_type : The type of time period if applicable, value : The number of cases recorded, unit : The type of values like cases, etc.
