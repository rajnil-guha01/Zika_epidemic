Zika epidemic was one of the worst epidemics that happened recently. It started out in Brazil and later spread to many parts of North and South America. It also spread to many islands of the Pacific and South-east Asia.  So this project takes a sample dataset about the spread of the epidemic and tries to understand the various dynamics regarding the spread of the epidemic.
